                            Some really good juice! We are rarely disappointed in any of the Seghesio Zinfandels but the Rockpile is a favorite. This baby is a fruit bomb and is lush, juicy and joyously lingers. Glad we held for eight years cause it is drinking wonderfully right now. We love this wine!
